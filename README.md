## Proposta de estudo üìã
Integrar duas plataformas para trocar dados (isso que entendi).

I work with the CRM Bitrix24 to manage the operations at our company. We are developing a Chatbot + Omnichannel at the Huggy platform. We need to integrate both platforms, accomplishing the following tasks:
- Get the order id sent by the client in the chatbot, search for it on Bitrix24 and return the order status in the chatbot.
- Send data from Huggy to Bitrix24, like average response time from an agent, as well as the satisfaction survey grade.

Here we have the docs for Huggy: https://developers.huggy.io/API/api-v3.html
And here for Bitrix24: https://training.bitrix24.com/rest_help/
